### COMPSCI 325: Introduction Human-Computer Interaction, Fall 2024
##### University of Massachusetts Amherst
I serve as a teaching assistant for this course, where I lead lectures on prototyping tools like Balsamiq and Figma. 
I mentor 12 teams, each with four students, guiding them through their final projects by assisting with literature reviews, 
persona generation, and conducting field studies such as interviews, surveys, and questionnaires. I hold weekly meetings 
with all teams to monitor their progress and provide ongoing feedback. Additionally, I evaluate their assignments and 
oversee the assessment of their final projects.

### CICS 110: Foundations of Programming, Fall 2023
##### University of Massachusetts Amherst
As the teaching assistant for the course, I conducted weekly lab/discussion sessions for over 100 undergraduate students and 
help them to solve coding problems using Python. I provided individual support during office hours to help students grasp 
core Python concepts. Additionally, I was responsible for evaluating assignments and exam scripts.
