I am a 4th-year PhD candidate at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences, 
UMass Amherst</a>. My research centers on data privacy and fairness in decision-making, with a focus on 
how we can protect sensitive information while ensuring equitable outcomes. I am especially interested in designing visual data 
exploration tools that make Differentially Private data more accessible and in studying the fairness trade-offs that come with 
Differential Privacy algorithms. I am advised by <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/nmahyar/">Prof. Narges Mahyar</a> and 
<a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/asarv/">Prof. Ali Sarvghad</a> in the <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hci-vis/">HCI-VIS 
Lab</a> at UMass. </p>

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a research assistant at the 
<a href='https://mmkhansajeeb.com/cailresearchgroup.html'>Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab (CAIL)</a>, 
where my work encompassed a diverse range of real-world problem-solving. These included tackling challenges 
in multi-agent coordination, optimization, as well as planning and scheduling. More specifically, I applied 
local search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based algorithms for solving Continuous Distributed Constraint Optimization
Problems (C-DCOPs) in multi-agent systems.
